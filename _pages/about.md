I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Sydeny in 2019. I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at the School of Civil Enigneering, the University of Sydney. My research interests include multiphase flow and multiscale modelling in porous media, investigated by serval numerical methods: molecular dynamics (nanoscale); coarse-grained molecular dynamics (microscale; and reservor simulation (reservior scale).
