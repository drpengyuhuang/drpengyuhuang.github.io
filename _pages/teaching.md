### Teaching experience at UTS, 2019-2020
I worked as a part-time lecturer and a tutor at UTS for the undergraduate course Construction Materials (48352) in 2019 and 2020. As a part-time lecturer, I have designed, prepared, and delivered lectures on steel materials of the course for three weeks successfully. 

### Teaching experience at USYD, 2016-2018
Teaching is an essential task in the academic career. I have been tutoring for three years at the University of Sydney, including CIVL1802 Statics (previously ENGG1802 Engineering Mechanics) for three semesters from 2016 to 2018 and CIVL3235 Structural Analysis for one semester in 2016 at the University of Sydney.
